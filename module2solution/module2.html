  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p align="right">Hobbies <br><br> “My hobbies are reading books and working out. Along with this, I also like cooking. While researching the company, I got to know about the in-house gym. Having a gym in the workplace is a great idea as employees can get to know each other better on a casual level apart from their designated roles.“</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p align="right">Education <br><br> I’m currently majoring in finance, with a minor in Japanese, at ABC University. I knew that I wanted to go into accounting from day one, so I chose a university with a strong finance program and a broad alumni network. In fact, I originally heard about this internship from an ABC University alumna: Ella Smith in your marketing department.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p align="right">Career<br><br> I graduated with my degree in Economics two months ago. I chose that field of study because I’ve always been interested in hello finance and money, and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options, too.</p></div>
